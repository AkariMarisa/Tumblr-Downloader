description: Capture an Android screenshot through .agents/tools/android and analyze the result.
allowed-tools: Bash(.agents/tools/android:*), Bash(adb:*)
argument-hint: what to inspect on the current screen
---

Preferred flow:

1. Run `.agents/tools/android screenshot --json`.
2. If the user asked for visual analysis, inspect the saved image with the agent's local image-view capability if available.
3. If you need precise element data, also run `.agents/tools/android ui dump --json`.
4. Report what is visible and answer the user's question.

If the command layer fails for screenshot capture, fall back to raw `adb` only as a last resort.
